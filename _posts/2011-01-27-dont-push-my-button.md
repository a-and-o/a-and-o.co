Today we were in a Florida prison playing music for them. I had never been in a Florida prison before but apparently you need a little contraption that looks like a garage door opener attached to your belt loop with a button on it that you can push in case of emergency so that guards can come running at you full speed and save you. Unfortunately this made us all even more uneasy than we were before because we were frightened we’d hit the button accidentally and cause an unnecessary ruckus. So the phrase of the day was.. ‘Don’t push my button.’

This has nothing to do with our wedding.
