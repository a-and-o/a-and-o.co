The other day my family and I were on tour we were eating at a McAlister’s Deli and we’d been driving all day so we just sat there and weren’t saying anything to each other. Meanwhile there was a group of middle-aged women; big, hefty, middle-aged women, discussing a book they were going to write, and whether their characters should sleep together or not.  

People. Interesting.
