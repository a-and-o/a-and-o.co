Today while going through the last of my things I found a CD of old pictures of my mom’s family that she nabbed from my grandma and scanned a few years ago. I love old photos. Here are a few. 

This is my Grandma Deloris. I love her dress!

This is the old farm house. It burned down when I was a kid.

These are my great-grandparents. I can’t remember their first names. They owned a store in Nebraska.

My mom, Ruth, in her sweet little dress. I love this.

Camera-shy Grandma Deloris smiling. This is a rare capture.

My mom—such a pretty girl. 

My Dad and his father-in-law, Grandpa Glenn, laughing. Grandpa always had a light in his eyes.
