*Stranger:* Hi.

*Me:* Hi.

*Stranger:* You wanna plank?

*Me:* No.

*Stranger:* It's where you… Well, if you don't know…

*Me:* No, I know.

*Stranger:* Oh, so do you want to?

*Me:* Still no.

For those of you that don't know, [this is planking](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planking_\(fad\)). Kind of a weird thing to do in the middle of National and Battlefield.
