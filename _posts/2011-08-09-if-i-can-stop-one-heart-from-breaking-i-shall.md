  ease one life the aching, \nOr cool one pain,\nOr help one fainting robin\nUnto
  his nest again, \nI shall not live in vain."

If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching, 
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again, 
I shall not live in vain.â€”Emily Dickinson
