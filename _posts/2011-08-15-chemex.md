There was an unfortunate incident in the kitchen last week involving our French Press, a fall, broken glass, and a distraught husband. Coffee is a pretty enjoyable part of our day and not having a means to make coffee was pretty sad for both of us, although I think it cuts to the core of Adam a bit more than me, so you can only imagine how hard last week was for him. 

It was fine though because we were fine, also, he’d been wanting to get a Chemex anyway and this was a great opportunity to invest. 

We took it over to [The Hub](http://www.insidethehub.com/) and our friend Isaac showed Adam the art of Chemex coffee and now we have real fancy morning coffees. *It’s so good.*
