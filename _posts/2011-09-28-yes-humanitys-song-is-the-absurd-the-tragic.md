title: Yes, humanity’s song is the absurd, the tragic, the comic; the profane and
  the beautiful; the fallen and the redeemed. Our society is fraught with inconsistencies
  and absurdities. We claim to believe that all of humankind is created equal in a
  country torn apart by racial tension. We deem killing to be punishable by death
  but honorable under the title of war. We claim to serve a God who loves the poor
  in rich cathedrals and gold plated steeples. We objectify women and wonder why daddy’s
  little girl has low self-esteem. The highs and lows, the dark and the light. This
  is the absurdity of our bipolar existence. Stretched thin between the dichotomy
  of death and breath, ashes and cash, pain and beauty. The scope of it all is enough
  to drive a man crazy.
