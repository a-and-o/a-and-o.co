  Cry to the night
  To the gaslight
  After the rain
  What shall I cry?
  Farewell, goodbye

  I leave you with your pain
  The Lord be with you
  And in your hour, again
  Tread in this cobble lane
  And rain His faith within you.
  Amen.

Cry to the night
To the gaslight
After the rain
What shall I cry?
Farewell, goodbye

I leave you with your pain
The Lord be with you
And in your hour, again
Tread in this cobble lane
And rain His faith within you.
Amen.â€”Julian
