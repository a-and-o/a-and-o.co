If everything is lost, thanks be to GodIf I must see it go, watch it go,Â Watch it fade away, dieThanks be to God that He is all I haveNothing at all, only a farewell to the windFarewell to the grey skyGoodbye, God be with you evening October sky.If all is lost, thanks be to God,For He is He, and I, I am only I.
