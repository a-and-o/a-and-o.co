  Forgive these wild and wandering cries,
  Confusions of a wasted youth;
  Forgive them where they fail in truth,
  And in Thy wisdom make me wise.

Forgive these wild and wandering cries,
Confusions of a wasted youth;
Forgive them where they fail in truth,
And in Thy wisdom make me wise.â€”Lord Alfred Tennyson
