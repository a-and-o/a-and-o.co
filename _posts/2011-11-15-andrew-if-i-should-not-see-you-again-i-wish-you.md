title: 'Andrew, if I should not see you again, I wish you to remember and treasure
  up some things I have already said to you: in this world you will have to make your
  own way. To do that you must have friends. You can make friends by being honest,
  and you can keep them by being steadfast. You must keep in mind that friends worth
  having will in the long run expect as much from you as they give to you. To forget
  an obligation or be ungrateful for a kindness is a base crime-not merely a fault
  or a sin, but an actual crime. Men guilty of it sooner or later must suffer the
  penalty. In personal conduct be always polite but never obsequious. None will respect
  you more than you respect yourself. Avoid quarrels as long as you can without yielding
  to imposition. But sustain your manhood always. Never bring a suit in law for assault
  and battery or for defamation. The law affords no remedy for such outrages that
  can satisfy the feelings of a true man. Never wound the feelings of others. Never
  brook wanton outrage upon your own feelings. If you ever have to vindicate your
  feelings or defend your honor, do it calmly. If angry at first, wait until your
  wrath cools before you proceed.'
