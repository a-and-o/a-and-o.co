> I sit beside the fire and think<br/>
> Of all that I have seen,<br/>
> Of meadow-flowers and butterflies<br/>
> In summers that have been;
> 
> Of yellow leaves and gossamer<br/>
> In autumns that there were,<br/>
> With morning mist and silver sun<br/>
> And wind upon my hair.
> 
> I sit beside the fire and think<br/>
> Of how the world will be <br/>
> When winter comes without a spring<br/>
> That I shall ever see. 
> 
> For still there are so many things<br/>
> That I have never seen:<br/>
> In every wood in every spring<br/>
> There is a different green. 
> 
> I sit beside the fire and think<br/>
> Of people long ago,<br/>
> And people who will see a world<br/>
> That I shall never know.
> 
> But all the while I sit and think<br/>
> Of times there were before,<br/>
> I listen for returning feet<br/>
> And voices at the door.

â€“ J. R. R. Tolkien
