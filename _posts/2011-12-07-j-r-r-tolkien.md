I sit beside the fire and think
Of all that I have seen,
Of meadow-flowers and butterflies
In summers that have been;

Of yellow leaves and gossamer 
In autumns that there were,
With morning mist and silver sun
And wind upon my hair.
I sit beside the fire and think
Of how the world will be 
When winter comes without a spring
That I shall ever see. 

For still there are so many things
That I have never seen:
In every wood in every spring
There is a different green. 

I sit beside the fire and think
Of people long ago,
And people who will see a world
That I shall never know.  

But all the while I sit and think
Of times there were before,
I listen for returning feet 
And voices at the door.
