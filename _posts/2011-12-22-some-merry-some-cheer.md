We opened our presents over the weekend because we’d certainly had a frightfully bothersome day and we figured what’s the point of cheer when you’d don’t need any cheering? And decided to put the holiday cheer to good use in cheering ourselves. We had a most beautiful evening with much glowing light and hot chamomile tea. We decided to write down all our favorite memories of the year and that set our hearts to glowing as well. We have had quite a year: many unfamiliar, scary, blessed things have happened to us and it’s beautiful to remember it all. 
Now, for some more merry-making…
