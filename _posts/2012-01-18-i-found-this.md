I found this in my ‘Quotes’ folder I keep on my computer. It was from a few years ago, something I said to Adam when we were dating, a.k.a IMing. 

> Audra just trimmed Emmett’s hair. he looks exactly the same. And he just walked in here and looked in the mirror and was shuffling his wet locks around and said ‘I don’t know….it’s a nice haircut, but I just don’t think it’s really me…you know?’

Two of my favorite people.
