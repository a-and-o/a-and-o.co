> I said, ‘I will guard my ways<br/>
> That I may not sin with my tongue;<br/>
> I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle<br/>
> While the wicked are in my presence.’<br/>
> I was mute and silent,<br/>
> I refrained even from good,<br/>
> And my sorrow grew worse.<br/>
> My heart was hot within me,<br/>
> While I was musing the fire burned;<br/>
> Then I spoke with my tongue:<br/>
> ‘Lord, make me to know my end<br/>
> And what is the extent of my days;<br/>
> Let me know how transient I am.<br/>
> Behold, You have made my days as handbreadths,<br/>
> And my lifetime as nothing in Your sight;<br/>
> Surely every man at his best is a mere breath.<br/>
> Surely every man walks about as a phantom;<br/>
> Surely they make an uproar for nothing;<br/>
> He amasses riches and does not know who will gather them.

– King David in Psalm 39
