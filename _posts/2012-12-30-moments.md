> When train wheels screech<br/>
> And plumes of smoke arise<br/>
> When snowflakes breach<br/>
> The cold and empty skies
> 
> Read to me of wonderers and whims<br/>
> Of a man who traveled over mountains grim<br/>
> Of the voices calling him
> 
> When billows break<br/>
> With revelry on stone<br/>
> When treetops quake<br/>
> And the ground beneath us groans
> 
> Sing to me of wars waged in the night<br/>
> Of courage true when all hope waned with the light<br/>
> Of a fallen hero’s plight
> 
> When voices cease<br/>
> And silence holds its ground<br/>
> While tea leaves steep<br/>
> And passing thoughts are bound
> 
> Sit with me in the warmth of our home<br/>
> Grateful God did not will for us to roam<br/>
> Nor to live our days alone

– Emmett Franz
