> A good name is better than a good ointment,
> And the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.
> It is better to go to a house of mourning
> Than to go to a house of feasting,
> Because that is the end of every man,
> And the living takes it to heart.
> Sorrow is better than laughter,
> For when a face is sad a heart may be happy.
> The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning,
> While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.
> It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man
> Than for one to listen to the song of fools.
> For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot,
> So is the laughter of the fool;
> And this too is futility.
> For oppression makes a wise man mad,
> And a bribe corrupts the heart.
> The end of a matter is better than its beginning;
> Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit.
> Do not be eager in your heart to be angry,
> For anger resides in the bosom of fools.
> Do not say, Why is it that the former days were better than these?
> For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this.
> Wisdom along with an inheritance is good
> And an advantage to those who see the sun.
> For wisdom is protection just as money is protection,
> But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors.
> Consider the work of God,
> For who is able to straighten what He has bent?
> In the day of prosperity be happy,
> But in the day of adversity consider-
> God has made the one as well as the other
> So that man will not discover anything that will be after him.
