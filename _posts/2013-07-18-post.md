Ireland: it is mentioned several times a day in our house. It cannot be overstated how beautiful the land of Ireland is. We spent a couple of weeks there last fall and they were some of the most glorious days of my life. I miss it. If you ever find that you can’t find us, we may have slipped back to the crashing waves on the Cliffs of Moher, or the misty Connemara mountains.
