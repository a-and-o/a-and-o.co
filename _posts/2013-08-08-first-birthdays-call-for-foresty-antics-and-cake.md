My youngest niece had her first birthday last week. Unfortunately she was rather grouchy from spending the week sick, and didn’t even thank us for all the trees and cakes but what can you do? Have a good time, of course! All her cousins got to be there with bells on. It was a true celebration of the life of the cutest little girl — even if she’s a bit somber — complete with a topsy-turvy cake and face masks of forest animals. Everything a one-year-old could ever dream of. Right?











When Kenna thought she was part of Caleb & Savannah’s family.
