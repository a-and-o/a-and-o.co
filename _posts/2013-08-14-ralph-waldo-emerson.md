> Every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults. As no man thoroughly understands a truth until he has contended against it, so no man has a thorough acquaintance with the hindrances or talents of man until he has suffered from the one and seen the triumph of the other over his own want of the same.

â€” Ralph Waldo Emerson
