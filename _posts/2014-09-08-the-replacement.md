Sometimes I get the impression I might be a different person, that one time—while I was sleeping—someone slipped in and switched out my brain. I know my body is the same, it still bears the scars of my childhood; but my mind is calmer, less haunted, more answered. Who would’ve done something like that? There are not many people who have access to my brain. And even less who have access coupled with the prowess required to switch one brain for another in the dead of night. Should we be afraid of thieves who steal, replace, and upgrade all at once? What is there to fear? Be heedful of whom you give access to your brain, discern whether they will improve or destroy in their one fell swoop.
