Tonight I was enjoying a supper of shrimp when a man came up to our table and put his hand on my shoulder and said ‘Excuse me, but I was just talking with my nephew and we think you have the most infectious smile’. He had apparently been at our concert tonight. It was a lovely comment, and it made me smile, which of course made him smile.
