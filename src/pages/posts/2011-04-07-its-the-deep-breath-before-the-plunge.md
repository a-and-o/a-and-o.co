Today is everything I imagine an April day to be. Uncertain. Trying the warm weather on for size. Spring is such a wondrous time of year. Every day I examine the trees, hoping to see some leaves sprouting out, and they do! That’s what’s so cool! Green, from nothing. God makes beautiful things out of the dust, as Michael Gungor reminds us… whenever we listen to that song. I was thinking yesterday about how the tree grows the seeds first, and lets them go, and then the leaves. They take care of the years to come before they let their canopies grow. I like it. It fascinates me.

Our wedding is next week, and Adam can tell you about the moment that first set in and the look on my face! Ha! It was Sunday night and I suddenly realized that our wedding was next week and the expression from the realization was, so I hear, quite memorable. I’m so incredibly excited to marry Adam. He is the most incredible, servant-hearted, giving, strong and smart person I know. And if I’m wrong, then I’ll just say he’s my favorite incredible, servant-hearted, giving, strong and smart person I know.

There are so many things to do, but it’s fun. It’s fun to get my hands to work doing pretty things, or at least arranging ugly things to some pretty end (hopefully) on Saturday. Lots of my friends who have gotten married have told me how stressed they are before the wedding, and they probably think I’m incredibly ridiculous to be saying it’s fun. I do see where the stress comes in, but I’m really trying to just relax. Adam reminds me daily in varying ways that all of this is just silliness, and if it doesn’t happen, it’s fine, we’ll be married. That’s the most beautiful, fun and exciting thing that could possibly happen on that day, and in my heart I completely agree. So that’s what we’re shooting for. I love being able to design a day and make it pretty, and I sincerely hope everyone who comes has just an amazing time, but it really is all silliness, I want them to remember the wedding not because it was pretty but because of how beautiful the things God makes is, and what a gift it is to be able to join two lives together.
