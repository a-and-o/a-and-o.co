Last night as I was falling asleep I was thinking to myself about how fast our brains can think. Has it ever happened to you that you were in a conversation and paused to think and then the next sentence that came out was so far away from the last thing you said to each other that it was pretty untraceable for the other person? Then, as one can often do, and as I often did as a child, you can think backwards and figure out how you got to your current thought. Well, I was doing this last night in my falling asleep stage, and I realized my brain works even faster than it’s usual fast pace when I’m sleeping, and I reasoned with myself, that that’s probably why we’ll say things in our sleep that don’t make sense.

If this doesn’t seem logical to you, it’s ok. It’s not.

Then,

I woke up around midnight last night to Adam saying something in his very normal and awake voice. He said,

It's really broken… I mean bright outside tonight. It's not usually like
that.

_Me:_ ‘Yeah… Have you been awake this whole time?’

_Adam:_ ‘Umm, what do you mean?’

_Me:_ ‘Since we went to bed.’

_Adam:_ ‘Mmm,’ many pauses and grunts involved.

\*At which point I went to the bathroom and when I came back I said,

'The hall light is shining on the trees outside, I'd never noticed it before last night but it is brighter than usual. You never answered me before, have you been awake since we went to bed?'

Grunt. Moan. ‘Ohhhh…’

_Me:_ ‘You’re such a grunter. Can you not remember?’

_Adam:_ ‘Not really.’

This man is hilarious.

This morning when I was waking up, (it was a different time than he woke up, so I called him over to wake up with me) he told me about how he had a dream but it was one of those awake dreams, when you’re not quite asleep but thinking really odd things. I always know I’m just about to fall asleep when I start thinking strangely. Well, more strangely than normal. He was thinking that he was a teleporter, but (like in X-Men 2) if he couldn’t see a room, he might not be able to get inside it and might get stuck in the wall, which, of course, would be really bad for him. Then he realized his arm was completely asleep and he thought to himself ‘Ah man, I got my arm stuck in the wall!’

These are the kind of thoughts we’re dealing with here. We’re like people from a home.
