_Stranger:_ Hi.

_Me:_ Hi.

_Stranger:_ You wanna plank?

_Me:_ No.

_Stranger:_ It's where you… Well, if you don't know…

_Me:_ No, I know.

_Stranger:_ Oh, so do you want to?

_Me:_ Still no.

For those of you that don't know, [this is planking](<http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planking_(fad)>). Kind of a weird thing to do in the middle of National and Battlefield.
