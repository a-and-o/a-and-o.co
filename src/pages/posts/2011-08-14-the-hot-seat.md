Last week I was wearing a dress and we were out to lunch with friends. It was a particularly sunny day and when we went to get back into the car my legs were quite concerned by the temperature of the leather against my skin. Adam was kind enough to grab a sweatshirt out of the trunk and lay it over my seat. Later, while driving home I asked Adam ‘Do you remember how sometimes it’s summer and we’re so cold we actually turn on seat warmers?’ 

Seasons are crazy.
