> If everything is lost, thanks be to God<br/>
> If I must see it go, watch it go,<br/>
> Watch it fade away, die<br/>
> Thanks be to God that He is all I have<br/>
> Nothing at all, only a farewell to the wind<br/>
> Farewell to the grey sky<br/>
> Goodbye, God be with you evening October sky.<br/>
> If all is lost, thanks be to God,<br/>
> For He is He, and I, I am only I.
