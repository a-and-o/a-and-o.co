> For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,<br/>
> And do not return there without watering the earth<br/>
> And making it bear and sprout,<br/>
> And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;<br/>
> So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;<br/>
> It will not return to Me empty,<br/>
> Without accomplishing what I desire,<br/>
> And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.

â€“ Isaiah 55:10 & 11
