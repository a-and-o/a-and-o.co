Some of the best conversations that occur in our home are when Adam decides to sit down and tell me all about what he’s figuring out. The thing is, I have no idea what he’s talking about. The other thing is, he’s amazingly good at breaking things down til I feel like I might have a grasp of the general concepts surrounding these nerdy and ethereal topics, (i.e. unix, GUIs, operating systems, Windows-bad, Apple-good, etc.)

I think I might be a secondhand web-developer.
