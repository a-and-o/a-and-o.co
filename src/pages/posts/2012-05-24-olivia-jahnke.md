> I am a house on a hill made of only brick and wood and stone.<br/>
> I was carved out by a man’s hands, but now I stand alone.<br/>
> My heart is cold and barren, no fire has burned for years.<br/>
> I am separate and dark, the kind that haunts a child’s fears.
>
> Do not try to wake me, I need unending rest.<br/>
> Do not try to rouse me, trust me, living death is best.<br/>
> Think of others in your quest, for I have grown too old.<br/>
> Pick up your things, leave me be, I am too cold to hold.
