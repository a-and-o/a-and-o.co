> Brother, just now you said: ‘Is there in all the world a being that could forgive and have the right to forgive?’ Well, that Being does exist, and It can forgive everything, everyone, man and woman alike, and for everything, because It gave Its innocent blood for all things and all men. You have forgotten about It, but on It the edifice is founded, and this it is that people will exclaim to It: ‘Just and true art Thou, O Lord, for Thy ways are made plain.’

– Aleksey Fyodorovich Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, _Brothers Karamazov_
