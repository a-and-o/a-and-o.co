I fell asleep last night at 8 o’clock… 8! Because I could not stay awake any longer. I woke up again two hours later and decided to move from the couch to bed because, you know, it’s bedtime now. I then woke up again when Adam joined me, I fell back to sleep. I woke up again at 2:30a and stayed awake for about an hour listening to our upstairs neighbors partying hard above us, mostly because I was so confused how people can make that much noise, also because I thought our ceiling might cave in—our bed was literally trembling—additionally because that’s hard to sleep through. Later I slept again until 8a.

It’s what I call 12 hours of interrupted sleep.
