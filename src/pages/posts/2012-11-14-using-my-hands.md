title: Using My Hands
---

I think it’s kind of crazy how our society doesn’t homemake many things anymore. In fact, people in my generation are so used to buying something at the store that it’s hard to even imagine that you could make it yourself. The truth is, I’m finding out, it’s a lot easier to make these things than one would think, and there are generally only a few ingredients, you can pronounce all of them, they make sense, it takes an hour, and then you’re set for months. Also, you get the personal satisfaction of having been incredibly resourceful, which is pretty priceless.

I made laundry detergent for the first time this week. I’d been wanting to do it for a while but for some reason thought it was going to take too much research to figure out the best way. Finally I just plunged in (Do people say that?). I spent about \$24 on detergent supplies that will last me years. I feel pretty darn good about that.
