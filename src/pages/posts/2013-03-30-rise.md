> Take courage sons, for we must go under the heart of darkness and set them free. But don’t lose heart when you see the numbers; There’s no measure for the faith we bring. It’s given us to overcome. If we run where the spirit calls us on, The greatest things have yet to come. With the dawn we will rise.

> Though they may surround me like lions, and crush me on all sides,
> I may fall, but I will rise. Not by my might, or my power, or by the strength of swords; only through your love my Lord.
> All we’ve lost, will be restored.

– Josh Garrels, *Rise*
