> A good name is better than a good ointment,<br/>
> And the day of one's death is better than the day of one's birth.<br/>
> It is better to go to a house of mourning<br/>
> Than to go to a house of feasting,<br/>
> Because that is the end of every man,<br/>
> And the living takes it to heart.<br/>
> Sorrow is better than laughter,<br/>
> For when a face is sad a heart may be happy.<br/>
> The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning,<br/>
> While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.<br/>
> It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man<br/>
> Than for one to listen to the song of fools.<br/>
> For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot,<br/>
> So is the laughter of the fool;<br/>
> And this too is futility.<br/>
> For oppression makes a wise man mad,<br/>
> And a bribe corrupts the heart.<br/>
> The end of a matter is better than its beginning;<br/>
> Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit.<br/>
> Do not be eager in your heart to be angry,<br/>
> For anger resides in the bosom of fools.<br/>
> Do not say, Why is it that the former days were better than these?<br/>
> For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this.<br/>
> Wisdom along with an inheritance is good<br/>
> And an advantage to those who see the sun.<br/>
> For wisdom is protection just as money is protection,<br/>
> But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors.<br/>
> Consider the work of God,<br/>
> For who is able to straighten what He has bent?<br/>
> In the day of prosperity be happy,<br/>
> But in the day of adversity consider<br/>
> God has made the one as well as the other<br/>
> So that man will not discover anything that will be after him.<br/>
