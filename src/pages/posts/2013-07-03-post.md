Airport bathrooms are disgusting. That being said, I’ve been using those plastic-paper toilet seat covers that they offer on the wall, you have to be very ginger with them, mind you. Every time I reach for one I think of my 2 year old niece reaching for one when I took her to the bathroom at the hospital and I remember thinking ‘Really? Your bottom covers a square two inches of the seat.’

Ah, she’s so cute though, you know?
