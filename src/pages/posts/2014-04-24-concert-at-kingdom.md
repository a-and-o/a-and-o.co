Tomorrow night I'm playing a show with these guys at [Kingdom Coffee](http://insidethehub.com). Emmett and Audra are my siblings and I play with them whenever it's possible; Kevin Cott I first met when he was a barista at the Hub (now Kingdom Coffee) and we worked there for a short time together, he's a stand-up fellow, thought-provoking, articulate, has good taste, and happens to be a great musician as well. I'm excited and honored to play with all three of them.
