> Come now, solemnest feast on the road to eternal freedom,<br/>
> Death, and destroy those fetters that bow, those walls that imprison<br/>
> this our transient life, these souls that linger in darkness,<br/>
> so that at last we see what is here withheld from our vision.<br/>
> Long did we seek you, freedom, in discipline, action and suffering.<br/>
> Now that we die, in the face of God himself we behold you.

â€“ An excerpt from Dietrich Bonhoeffer's poem, *Death*
