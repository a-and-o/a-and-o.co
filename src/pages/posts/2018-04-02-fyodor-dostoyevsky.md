> Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age- it has not
> fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For everyone strives to
> keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest
> possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not
> in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for instead of
> self-realisation he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our
> age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove;
> each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and
> he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by
> himself and thinks, 'How strong I am now and how secure,' and in his madness
> he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into
> self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone
> and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe
> in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he
> should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself.
> Everywhere in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that
> the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated
> individual effort. But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an
> end, and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from
> one another. It will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that
> they have sat so long in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign
> of the Son of Man will be seen in the heavens… . But, until then, we must keep
> the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his conduct
> seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men's souls out of
> their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love, that the great
> idea may not die.

– The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky
