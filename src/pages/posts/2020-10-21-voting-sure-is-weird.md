[Trump’s suburban collapse costs him in Nebraska](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/18/trump-nebraska-problem-suburbs-429250)

> [...] in 2008, Barack Obama, carrying the 2nd District, picked off one of the electoral votes, marking the first time in 44 years that a Democrat had accomplished that feat.
> 
> Stunned, Republicans in the state’s legislature re-drew the 2nd District lines to make it safer for the GOP, adding the more conservative, western suburbs of Sarpy County to the city of Omaha. Obama lost the reconfigured district to Mitt Romney in 2012, and Trump carried it narrowly four years later.

Cool, cool, cool. Why is this still happening? Why is this legal?

[Amy Coney Barrett on climate change: "I would not say I have firm views on it.”](https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/amy-coney-barrett-on-climate-change)

Eric Holthaus pretty accurately summarized my democracy wishlist:

> This whole thing makes it clear that democracy as we know it in the United States is broken.
> 
> We need radical reforms to democracy to move quickly on the climate emergency and act with justice for the rights of people whose voices have been silenced for too long.
> 
> Automatic voter registration.
> 
> Removing the filibuster from the Senate.
> 
> An end to gerrymandering.
> 
> An expanded Supreme Court.
> 
> Abolishing the Electoral College.
> 
> Guaranteed representation in Congress for tribal Nations.
> 
> Statehood for DC and every US territory.
> 
> All of these would restore and strengthen voting rights for people of color and folks on the front lines of climate change. None of these actions should be controversial.
