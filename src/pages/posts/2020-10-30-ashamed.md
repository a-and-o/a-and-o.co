The contrast of these two statements from Biden/Pence is really something to behold:

https://www.christianpost.com/voices/president-trump-is-the-best-choice-for-americans-of-faith.html

This is an incredibly blasphemous statement, but is the view of many of my Christian friends and family, which causes me great shame and embarrassment:

> Our freedoms are a gift from our Creator, and when we defend them, we make His work on earth our own.
â€“ Mike Pence

A great delusion falls upon those who imagine God working through various Caesars, ancient and modern.

Until we truly see the kingdom of God this delusion is almost inevitable.

Jesus told Nicodemus that unless he was born again, he could not perceive the kingdom of God.

Selah.
